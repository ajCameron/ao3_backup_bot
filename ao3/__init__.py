"""

Programmatic tools to access and download from ao3.

Original fork from https://github.com/wendytg/ao3_api
Alterations are my own fault.

Public API for the ao3 package.

Typical usage:

    import ao3

    session = ao3.Session()
    work = ao3.Work(123456)
    work.fetch()  # if your Work model lazily loads

    # Helpers live under ao3.utils
    wid = ao3.utils.workid_from_url("https://archiveofourown.org/works/123456")

Only the names exported here are considered stable.
Everything else should be treated as internal and may change without notice.
